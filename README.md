# Hello World 
## About this profile
This is my GitHub profile and this is quite my first ever attempt at a GitHub profile.
Hopefully you (the reader) will eventually find this a little bit fuller with repositories and colaborations to other projects.

## About me
Im currently a Systems and Informatics engineer student at college.
Taking an internship at a local bussiness called Eracli Systems.
And I want to try out new things and ideas hopefully becoming a silly Gen Z programmer.

## Why create an account?
For one, its a really useful tool to know and manage.
Secondly, everyone else knows how to use it.
And lastly,I personally believe on the freedom of information and open source, so i think this might a good start.


### If you have any cool ideas or know of any cool repositories out there please do let me know.


### Thats it folks!!
